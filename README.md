# Reading Speed App

The idea for the app is to visualize how reading at certain speeds looks like and feels like, say 250 words per minute look like. This is currently a work in progress.

## MVP Features
- Highlight word by word according to the speed selected
- Make all other words in text blured out, or grayer
- Start and stop buttons
- Select different speeds
