		This is a single-serving app for visualizing what it's like to read at different words per
		minute (wpm) speeds. The idea is to explore what it looks like to read slow (150wpm or less) or
		fast (300wpm or more).
	</p>

	<p>
		This isn't exactly the way we read, we read in chunks of words, but I think it's a good
		aproximation.
